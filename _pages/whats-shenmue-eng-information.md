The patching tool has only been tested with the discs that contain the following codes 
on the inner part of the non-labeled side:  
- 610-7179-0133A 11MB1  
- 610-7179-0133A H1723E

If you are going to use a disc with a different code, please try it out and then tell 
us what happens and what's your ring code.

PacoChan patcher only admits GDI format images that will be turned into MDS/MDF images, 
ready to be used in real hardware.

**CHANGELOG:**

- 1.0: First release.
  - Every menu and subtitle is fully translated into English. A few key graphics were translated as well.
- 1.0.1: Minor update.
  - Fixed a couple of typos in the generic NPCs.
- 1.0.2: Minor update.
  - The patcher now allows exporting to the GDI format.
  - Minor changes to the German translation.
- 1.0.3: Translation fixes.
  - Changed some pedestrian texts in the three languages. Thanks to StuntmanSnake for the tip.
  - Switched the quotation marks to angled quotation marks in the Spanish translation.
- 1.0.3b: Minor fix.
  - Fixed the line jumps in the English translation.
- 1.0.4: Brazilian Portuguese translation added.
  - Minor fixes on the game textures.

**KNOWN ERRORS**  
 - Various borders appear on the starting credits when playing in Demul. 
 This is an emulator defect.  
- Lips or subtitles show up a bit late in real hardware. This defect apparently 
already was in the original game.

Please check the readme file for more information. You can find it in the 
Parcheador package.
